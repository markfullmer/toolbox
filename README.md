## Bash Toolkit
This project includes simple time-saving scripts & shortcuts to speed development.

They should work with any UNIX-style terminal emulator.

### Usage
In whatever file is loaded by your terminal on startup (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`), source the included file along the lines of:

```bash
source ~/.toolbox.sh
```
